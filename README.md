About
=====

<p> This pomodoro timer is just a terminal cronometer to help organize your time, according to the pomodoro method (seek on google).</p>
<p> We use python curses here to deliver fantastic ASCII art :} </p>
<p> It also works good when terminal window is constantly being resized, which happens while tiling window managers like Xmonad are in use.</p>

Usage
=====

 - Run the script...<br>
 ` $ python pwnmodoro.py //this will launch a standard timing pattern (25min work and 5min break) `<br>
 ` $ python pwnmodoro.py 15 //you can specify a custom work time `
